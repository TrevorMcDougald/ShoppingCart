# Shopping Cart Project
This was originally a project for CS 3320: Internet Software
Development. It is a fork from
[This](https://github.com/georgeotj/InternetSoftwareDev3320) repository.
The previous version used jQuery on the frontend and served files with
EJS on the backend through Express. In this version I'll be rewriting
the frontend with React, Redux, GraphQL, and Storybook. 

The Express application will simply be an API for the Store. 

I'm working on deploying the application with Docker, Kubernetes, and through AWS
